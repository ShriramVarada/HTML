/* If the two selectors are identical,
the latter of the two will take
precedence. Here you can see
the second i selector takes
precedence over the first.

If one selector is more specific
than the others, the more
specific rule will take precedence
over more general ones. In this
example:
h1 is more specific than *
p b is more specific than p
p#intro is more specific than p

You can add !important after
any property value to indicate
that it should be considered
more important than other rules
that apply to the same element. */
